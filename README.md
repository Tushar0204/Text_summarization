# Text_summarization
Hello this is repository for Text summarization project.
It contains code for two files. The first one is 'Health.txt' and other one is 'News.text'



From 'Health.txt' information about health sector is collected,tokenized,and summarized using frequency summarization(most frequent words).

   the approach in the code is frequency summarization using most frequent words


From 'News.txt' information about health sector is collected,tokenized,and summarized using frequency summarization(least frequent words).
      
       the approach in the code is frequency summarization using least frequent words because rare news headlines should be more important.
